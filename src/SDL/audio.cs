The hints SDL_HINT_WAVE_RIFF_CHUNK_SIZE, SDL_HINT_WAVE_TRUNCATION, and SDL_HINT_WAVE_FACT_CHUNK can be used to tune the behavior of the loading process.Any file that is invalid (due to truncation, corruption, or wrong values in the headers), too big, or unsupported causes an error. Additionally, any critical I/O error from the data source will terminate the loading process with an error. The function returns NULL on error and in all cases (with the exception of  being NULL), an appropriate error message will be set.It is required that the data source supports seeking.Example:

This will return -1 to signify an error if you use it with capture devices.)SDL offers two ways to feed audio to the device: you can either supply a callback that SDL triggers with some frequency to obtain more audio (pull method), or you can supply no callback, and then SDL will expect you to supply data at regular intervals (push method) with this function.There are no limits on the amount of data you can queue, short of exhaustion of address space. Queued data will drain to the device as necessary without further intervention from you. If the device needs audio but there is not enough queued, it will play silence to make up the difference. This means you will have skips in your audio playback if you aren't routinely queueing sufficient data.This function copies the supplied data, so you are safe to free it when the function returns. This function is thread-safe, but queueing to the same device from two threads at once does not promise which buffer will be queued first.You may not queue audio on a device that is using an application-supplied callback; doing so returns an error. You have to use the audio callback or queue audio with this function, but not both.You should not call  on the device before queueing; SDL handles locking internally for this function.

        /// Dequeue more audio on non-callback devices.(If you are looking to queue audio for output on a non-callback playback device, you want  instead. This will always return 0 if you use it with playback devices.)SDL offers two ways to retrieve audio from a capture device: you can either supply a callback that SDL triggers with some frequency as the device records more audio data, (push method), or you can supply no callback, and then SDL will expect you to retrieve data at regular intervals (pull method) with this function.There are no limits on the amount of data you can queue, short of exhaustion of address space. Data from the device will keep queuing as necessary without further intervention from you. This means you will eventually run out of memory if you aren't routinely dequeueing data.Capture devices will not queue data when paused; if you are expecting to not need captured audio for some length of time, use  to stop the capture device from queueing more data. This can be useful during, say, level loading times. When unpaused, capture devices will start queueing data from that point, having flushed any capturable data available while paused.This function is thread-safe, but dequeueing from the same device from two threads at once does not promise which thread will dequeued data first.You may not dequeue audio from a device that is using an application-supplied callback; doing so returns an error. You have to use the audio callback, or dequeue audio with this function, but not both.You should not call  on the device before queueing; SDL handles locking internally for this function.

For playback devices, the hardware will start playing silence if more audio isn't queued. Unpaused capture devices will start filling the queue again as soon as they have more data available (which, depending on the state of the hardware and the thread, could be before this function call returns!).This will not prevent playback of queued audio that's already been sent to the hardware, as we can not undo that, so expect there to be some fraction of a second of audio that might still be heard. This can be useful if you want to, say, drop any pending music during a level change in your game.You may not queue audio on a device that is using an application-supplied callback; calling this function on such a device is always a no-op.
